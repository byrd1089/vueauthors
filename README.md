> A Vue.js 2.0 project

I'm new to Vue.js, and while the Vue documentation is excellent, some of the concepts were difficult to get my head around.
There are many examples of various Vue helper libraries, but I could never find what I wanted, something that tied it all together.
So I've created the simple Vue CRUD application example that I couldn't find.

I hope that it may help others.

This small demonstration application is my take on how to manage CRUD actions using
* vue.js
* vue-router
* vue-router-sync
* vuex
* vuelidate

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```

This application was create using the [vuestart](https://github.com/ssouron/vuestart) CLI template.
